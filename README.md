# Basic HardHat Project

* The project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case.
* The Smart Contract uses a Russian Roulette Function that can be used to bet any amount of available tokens between two players.
* It comes with a sample contract, a basic test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, 
and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.
* Technologies used - Solidity, HardHat, JavaScript

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
